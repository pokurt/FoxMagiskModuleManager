# Welcome to Fox's Magisk Module Manager community

These guidelines set forth our expectations for our communities, not limiting but including our GitHub Repository, our Telegram groups, and other affiliated groups/communities. They really boil down to three principles:

1) Don't be a dick.
2) A dick do not be.
3) Review rules 1 and 2.

We believe in free speech, and freedom of expression, insofar that it doesn't interfere with others' right to the same. Contributors, community members, developers, and users alike are welcome here, but you must extend the same welcome to other members. So long as you can follow those three principles, you are welcome here, whether it's to hand out, lurk, or more directly contribute.

## What we do not allow

Absolutely no harrassment including, but not limited to, harassment based on the basis of sexuality, gender, race, or other beliefs shall be tolerated. We want everyone to feel safe and welcome here, and when some community members harass others, that is made much harder.

Harassment is defined as, as per the english dictionary:
```
noun: harassment; plural noun: harassments
  aggressive pressure or intimidation.
  "they face daily harassment and assault on the streets"
```

We will also not tolerate any illegal activity, including but not limited to, copyright infringement, license infringement, threats, violence, doxxing, or any activity not legal in any team member's or developers home country.

## What we do allow

We believe free speech and discussions are vital to the health of a community. When everyone can speak freely, we all get along much better. Keep in mind, you must extend that same freedom to everyone else. That means to allow others to speak their mind just as you have, without attempting to stifle their same freedom of speech or expression.

### Specifics for code contributions

All code submitted must follow existing code standards, including but not limited to, formatting, licensing, and code style. Code must also be the submitters own work or used under license, and the submitter must make a good faith effort to test and ensure it works correctly.

## Enforcement

While the police will not show up at your house for violating our rules, we reserve the right but not the obligation to issue warnings and/or ban users as we see fit for violations of this Code of Conduct.

You are welcome to contact any maintainer privately if you need help or wish to report another member of the community for violation of these rules, and your complaint will be handled fairly and privately.

By interacting with our community or participating in the same, you acknowledge you understand and accept this Code of Conduct.
